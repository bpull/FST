This directory contains the template authentication and database system.

While this is not necessary for calendar use, this is included here as it
is now part of the integrated calendar framework.

Usage: 
- Configure config.inc.php (preferable outside of this directory)
- Add the appropriate tables to the database
- Add the server.php to the dmz servers where authentication works (www.usna.edu)
- Then call client.php for authentication
