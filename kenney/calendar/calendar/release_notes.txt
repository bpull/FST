           providing a way to see each day of summer school.

           crash if it was not able to recurse into a directory.

           keyword, respectively.
         - Added Search box on the navbar

             class_1/filename         class_3/answersheet.txt
             class_1/homework         * using homework/title will work with
             class_1/title            * those items normally shown on calendar

           the web server user would prevent only partial reads of the files
           within a directory.
